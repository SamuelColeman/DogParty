# DogParty

For this project, I attempted to recreate a static web page using HTML and CSS. I wrote my code using the text editor Sublime. Below is the original page that I was given and the fonts/colors that were used.

* Light blue: #75e2e6
* Dark blue: #048eaa
* Background color: #ffffff
* White text: #ffffff
* Body text: #000000
* Font: Open Sans
